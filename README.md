# Project-Mangement-Database

This was our group project for Database Systems. In a company, many employees are working on different projects, it gets difficult to track them. We made a relational database to solve this problem. We made DDL queries, DML queries, Logical Schema, and Physical Schema. Views, functions, procedures, roles, and logs are also added to the database. We used Oracle Developer and SQL for these tasks.
